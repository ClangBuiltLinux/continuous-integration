Usage: ./driver.sh <options>

Script description: Build a Linux kernel image with Clang and boot it

Environment variables:
  The script can take into account specific environment variables, mostly used
  with Travis.  They can be invoked either via 'export VAR=<value>;
  ./driver.sh' OR 'VAR=value ./driver.sh'

  ARCH:
      If no ARCH value is specified, arm64 is the default. Currently, arm32_v7,
      arm32_v6, arm32_v5, arm64, ppc64le and x86_64 are supported.
  LD:
      If no LD value is specified, ${CROSS_COMPILE}-ld is used. arm64 only.
  REPO:
      Nicknames for trees:
        linux (default)
        linux-next
        4.19
        4.14
        4.9
        4.4

Optional parameters:
  -c | --clean:
      Run 'make mrproper' before building the kernel. Normally, the build
      system is smart enought to figure out what needs to be rebuilt but
      sometimes it might be necessary to clean it manually.
  -j | --jobs
      Pass this value to make. The script will use all cores by default but
      this isn't always the best value.
